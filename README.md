# Requirment
Project was done using pure python, so to run this project. we are gonna need to install the latest version of python from **The Original Website** *https://www.python.org/downloads/* . or from **pip** , in powershell or command prompt, you can : *python get-pip.py*. Second, you will need to set up the Environment in your Device, one way to do it is by using command prompt: choose a file in your machine then track it using **cd** then create the virtual Environment *python3 -m venv venv* . then after activating it. install all the requirment listed below.

In this project, we are going to use HTTP to send a GET request to newsAPI.org. to have the ability to do that we are gonna be needing to install **Requests**, which is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library and to istall it using pip **:** *pip install requests*
Required Dependancies: install requests

# How To

**Steps in Configuration:**

**Configure Environment:** Verify that Python is installed on your computer. It is available for download from Python.org.
Use venv or virtualenv to optionally build up a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
Establishing the Project: Take a clone of the project repository using a version control system (like Git).
Go to the project directory by navigating. Utilizing pip, install the project dependencies.

**Launch the server:**
Launch the project's main Python file. For instance, execute the server.py and make sure that you have the python script called "Menu"; which is an extension of the erver script.

Keep an eye on the output: Look for any error messages or signs that the server has started up successfully in the terminal or console output. *Log messages* usually indicate whether or not the server is listening on a specific port. if so, rerun the server.py then the client.py. You should notice log messages showing that the server is up and operating and waiting for incoming connections if it begins correctly.

# The Script

**The Client-Server Script :** This project includes three Python scripts with the menu as an extension of the server script.Â
